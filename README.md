# AFF Frontend

## Overview
Front-end application for aff. AFF is a fashion-tech platform that connects clients, designers and tailors for possible work collaborations and purchase of fashion garments.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Tech Stack
- Next.js
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Zustand
- Three.js
- Fabric.js


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.


## Contributing 
- Each page or work should have a new branch. The branch name should be named in the format; "ft-pageName", fix-fixName, refactor-featureName

- Create a PR to merge into dev from your feature/page branch, which will be reviewed and merged by the organisation admin.

- Use DRY coding methods

- Refactored and well modular codes please.

- Reusable components are highly expected

- Adherence to folder structure

- Adherence to coding standards like in terms of casing, structure, orderliness, lint rules.

- Distinct seperation of client vs server-side code

- Remember to keep your branch up to date by originally checking out of dev and regularly pulling in dev
